As my first post, I wanted to show you my workbench where all the magic happens. I was looking around for a workbench I could just buy, but I never found exactly what I wanted at the price I wanted after 2 weeks of searching. I wanted 3 things:
* Long enough to have a solder station, printer, and computer
* A large light overhead
* Have a working surface about counter high

So I decided I would just build a workbench. The internet had tons of plans and styles. I found one that was easy and cheap, but had the features I wanted. I actually built the workbench [here](https://www.familyhandyman.com/workshop/workbench/how-to-build-a-workbench-super-simple-50-bench/). It is a rock solid bench. I bought everything at Home Depot I think I spent around $70 on it after everything was done.  

Once I had the workbench, I got to work setting up everything on it. As you can see in the photo I put my 3D printer on the far right, solder station in the middle, and my computer workstation on the far left. My printer is hooked up to the network via a 2nd generation raspberry pi (more on that next post), so it didn't have to plug directly into my computer workstation. The printer cost $180 and the raspberry pi was $30 a few years ago. 

I wanted my solder station in the middle of the bench so it could grow on either side as larger projects come and go. I bought the soldering iron and accessories at Radio Shack when they were closing up shop. I think it cost me a total of $20. I bought a small parts drawer to complete my solder station for $10 at Walmart. 

As for my computer, I ended up pulling out an old laptop and monitor I had from college and installed ubuntu on it. Ubuntu is a very popular Linux based operating system. It's super easy for beginners and is light on resource requirements so it works great on old hardware. Since the computer equipment was bought in college, its depreciated to nothing. I did have to but a keyboard and mouse though. I purchased them at my local Microcenter for a whopping $6 total ($3 each). So lets say I spent $6 on the computer. I may write a post up about how I have the computer software all setup later.

So lets compute the total cost for my workbench, printer, computer station, and soldering station:   

$ 70 - Workbench  
$180 - Printer  
$ 30 - Soldering Station  
$  6 - Computer Station  
\------------------  
$286 - Total
