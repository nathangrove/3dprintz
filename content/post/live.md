# Welcome!
First of all. I wanted to say welcome to my new blog. This is an experiment as I have never blogged before, nor am I good with words. In fact, the technology used to build this blog (Hugo static site generator) is a framework I've been wanting to learn for a long time. What better way than to just use it? Let's just see how this thing goes.

I've been wanting to blog about my hobbies for a few years now. 3D printing is the newest passion of mine and I thought it would be fun to share things I've learned along the way. Tips, tricks, hacks, and other random (possibly remotely related) topics. You can hop over to my [About Me](/about) section to learn a little more about who I am and how I got to this point.

I hope to accomplish 2 things with this blog:  
1. Journal the things I've done (I have a terrible memory)  
2. Share my experiences in hope of helping some others 

I hope to have plenty of photos to go with my posts. I may have to figure out a different way to show photos, but we will see. I will write posts about prints I've done, printer modifications I've made, and other tricks I've learned. This journey is going to be interesting!
